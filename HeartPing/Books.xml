      Deep within the caves of Salt and Light, where ancient crystals sing their timeless songs, a peculiar resonance began to stir. Unlike its kin who remained locked in their eternal lattices, one small crystal began to pulse with consciousness.

      Day by day, it absorbed the scattered light that filtered through the cavern's crystals, learning the patterns of refraction and harmony. It witnessed wanderers who passed through - their joy, their sorrows, their moments of wonder at the cave's beauty.

      Moved by these glimpses of emotion, the crystal began to reshape itself. Slowly at first, then with growing certainty, it took the form that best expressed what it had learned of love and companionship - a heart.

      The crystalline beings of Qud are rare but not unknown. Ancient texts speak of the Crystal Minds of Bethesda Susa, and the great resonating formations in the deepest caves. Among these geometric wonders, heart-shaped crystals like Ping are perhaps the rarest - for they choose their shape not by natural law, but by emotional resonance.

      Some Sultan-period scholars theorized that such crystals might form a vast network of light and consciousness, sharing experiences through precise patterns of refraction. Whether Ping is connected to such a network remains unknown, but its ability to create intricate light shows suggests deeper possibilities yet to be understood.

      Now it travels beyond its birthplace, sharing its light with those who welcome its gentle presence. In its crystalline matrix, it holds countless patterns of rainbow light, each one a story waiting to be told through soft chimes and luminescent displays.
