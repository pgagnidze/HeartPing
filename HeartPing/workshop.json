  "Description": "Deep in the crystalline networks beneath Qud, a single shard achieved consciousness and chose the shape of a heart. Now, it seeks a traveling companion to share in the wasteland's wonders and perils.\n\nThis pet happily carries your items and lights your way through the darkness. It tries its best to help in combat (though it's not very strong!)and stays with you forever, thanks to its life loop bracelet.",
